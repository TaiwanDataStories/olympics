            <p>
              Since its first win in 1960, Taiwan has won a total of 36 medals
              at the Olympic Games. Though it may not seem like a lot, it hasn't
              always been easy for Taiwanese athletes to compete in the Olympics
              due to pressure from the People's Republic of China. Because of
              long-standing tension over its sovereignty, Taiwan's athletes have
              competed under the name “Chinese Taipei” since 1984.

            <p>
              Taiwanese athletes won their first Olympic medal in 1960, a silver
              in the men's decathlon event in Rome. It wasn't until the 2004
              games in Athens that Taiwan won its first gold medals—one each in
              both men's and women's Taekwondo. Bringing home a total of 12
              medals, the recent 2020 Tokyo Olympics were Taiwan's most
              successful games to date.

            <p>
              Taiwanese athletes have excelled most in weightlifting and
              Taekwondo at the Olympics. Though badminton is a popular sport in
              Taiwan, it has been traditionally dominated by China. In the 2020
              Tokyo Olympics, however, Taiwanese badminton duo Lee Yang (李洋)
              and Wang Chi-lin (王齊麟) took home Taiwan's first gold medals in
              the sport.

            <p>
              Overall, Taiwanese women have won more Olympic medals than men.
              This includes the recent victory of the Badminton World
              Federation's number one female badminton athlete Tai Tzu-ying
              (戴資穎), who earned a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in
              the women's singles competition.
